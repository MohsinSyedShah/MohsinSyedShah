### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mohsin(he/him), I am currently a student at Central Univeristy of Lancashire , in the Computing and Science building, I am studying about Cyber Security and Software Engineering. Each week on a Tuesday we have a online class where interactively learn about Coding, programming and Cyber security as, applying methods and inputs to secure systems and softwares. And, every week on Wednesdays we attend in person to work in computerlab, on assignments relating to the knowledge gained from online classes.  
After this bootcamp course I aspire to secure a work and learn opportunity to build further on knowledge , skills and experience. I would love to collaborate my learning, knowledge and experience with fellow students and colleagues. I would like to be helped with putting  my sofar gained experience in action. Ask me about git and git hub repositories, "how to make/save changes,pull/push request, C# programming language , the basics, Visual Studio Code, securing web system and database by fixing vulnerabilities by using clean code, cryptography methods, the vignere code, secure websystems. A fun fact about myself is I lived in the Netherlands for 25 years and I speak Dutch language fluently.
